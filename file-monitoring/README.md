The purpose of this script is to have a configurable and automated way of finding "undesirable" files.

The initial use case is finding people leaving large uncompressed text or fastq files laying around for a very long time.

The eventual goal is to automate the pestering of rule-breaking users. 

It uses the configuration file "file-parameters.ini" in the local directory, currently.
